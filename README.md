# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains my **personal portfolio website**, designed and developed from scratch as part of the **Intro to Software Engineering** course.

The goal of this project is to present my professional profile, showcase selected projects, and demonstrate my skills in **HTML, CSS, responsive design, and JavaScript**, following modern best practices and a clean project structure.

## 🛠️ How the Portfolio Was Built

This project was developed incrementally, following a structured learning path:

- **HTML fundamentals & semantic structure**  
  Use of semantic tags (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`) for accessibility and clarity.

- **CSS styling & layout**  
  Custom styles, Flexbox layout, pixel-style UI elements, and consistent visual identity.

- **Responsive design**  
  Media queries optimized for small screens (including 320px devices), ensuring usability across devices.

- **Advanced CSS & interactivity**  
  Animations, hover effects, custom cursors, and UI polish.

- **JavaScript enhancements**  
  Interactive sound effects, Easter egg logic, and enhanced user feedback.

- **Version control & deployment**  
  Git-based workflow with feature branches and deployment via GitHub Pages.
